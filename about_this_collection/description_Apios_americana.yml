organism.description:	Potato bean (Apios americana) produces starchy, high-protein tubers that were used by indigenous Native Americans. Apios americana is found throughout eastern and central North America, from Louisiana in the south to Quebec in the north. A breeding program was begun in the 1980s by Dr. Bill Blackmon and Berthal Reynolds with the goal of creating a more marketable domesticated tuber.
